  <h1>1980's Home Computerss</h1>
  <p>In early 1980's, home computers became mainstream. For the first time, computers could be
        purchased by an average family household..</p>

<h2>Clever uses</h2>
    <p>The main usage for a home computer was, of course, games. As cool games may not be a valid reason
        for purchasing an expensive gadget, a wide variety of potential uses were invented to satisfy those
        family members who might otherwise be sceptical.</p>
    
    <h2>Legendary computers</h2>
    <p>The best known computer of the eighties was Commodore 64, but there are other computers that gained popularity.</p>

    <h2>Key concepts</h2>
    <p>The hardware charateristics of a home computer could be defined by its graphics and sound capabilities, CPU, and amount of memory.</p>
    <p>Some reasons often mentioned were:</p>
    
  <ul>
    <li>Learning to write computer programs</li>
    <li>Managing family finances</li>
    <li>Keeping track of freezer contests</li>
  </ul>
  
  
  <p>There are two types of memory:</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>RAM</dt>
        <dd>Random access memory. The memory usable by programs. The amount was typically
        in the ballpark of 20 to 64 kilobytes. However, the Basic interpreter by default
        consumed a part of this.</dd>

        <dt>ROM</dt>
        <dd>Read-only memory. This was normally smaller in size than RAM and roughly
        corresponded to the hardware implementation of the operating system.</dd>
    </dl>
